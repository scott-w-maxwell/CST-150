# Activity 9

A method stub, or signature, is the first line of a method.

Write a class that contains the following “stubs” for methods used in measurement conversion and include a screenshot of your program running with successful output. You do not have to implement the methods.

Here’s an example:

Write a void method that takes an integer for the number of millimeters and displays the number of meters.

Correct response:

public void showMeters(int numMillimeters){}

1. Write a method that takes two integers and displays their sum.
2. Write a method that takes five doubles and returns their average.
3. Write a method that returns the sum of two randomly generated integers.
4. Write a method that takes three integers and returns true if their sum is divisible by 3, false otherwise.
5. Write a method that takes two strings and displays the string that has fewer characters.
6. Write a method that takes an array of doubles and returns the largest value in the array.
7. Write a method that generates and returns an array of fifty integer values.
8. Write a method that takes two bool variables and returns true if they have the same value, false otherwise.
9. Write a method that takes an int and a double and returns their product.
10. Write a method that takes a two-dimensional array of integers and returns the average of the entries.
