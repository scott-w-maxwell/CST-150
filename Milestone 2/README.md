Milestone 2
----
This milestone has three parts:

Part 1: Use UML class diagrams to model your inventory item class.

Part 2: Implement the inventory item class.

Part 3: Test the inventory item class.

Deliverables:

- A cover sheet with name, date, and assignment title.
- A UML class diagram of the inventory item class.
- Code that implements the inventory item class.
- A driver method or unit tests for the inventory item class.
> NOTE: A console application is sufficient to test the class; however, you may want to make a connection between your high-fidelity prototype and your inventory item. In other words, display and/or modify an inventory item in your user interface.

- Submit all deliverables in a single zip file in the LMS.
- In your GIT repository, submit all deliverables as individual files.
