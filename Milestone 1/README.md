Deliverables:

- A cover sheet with name, date, and assignment title.
- A list of the properties, complete with data type and description that will describe an inventory item in your system. Submit this as a .pdf file.
- A low-fidelity prototype of your system’s flow of interactions. This should be originally hand-drawn and submitted as a .pdf file.
- A high-fidelity prototype of your system’s interface. This should be developed in Visual Studio using .NET tools. Take a screenshot of all windows and submit as a single .pdf file.
